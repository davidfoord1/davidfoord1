ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David.

Iâ€™m learning R programming for data analysis, including:
- How to package, test and document - [Demo string manipulation package](https://davidfoord1.github.io/suitestrings/)
- As well as R fundamentals in general - [Deep R exercise book](https://davidfoord1.github.io/deep-r-exercise-book/)

I'm learning, practicing and advocating for Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) in healthcare analysis.
- Including version control systems and open source - [A case for using GitHub](https://davidfoord1.github.io/A-case-for-using-GitHub/)
